# CLAUDE.md

Config repo for **cpam.tv** — a personal Plex media server and its supporting stack.
This checkout (Windows/WSL) is a working copy; the live deployment lives on the Plex
server at `/home/plex/cpam` (compose files are invoked from that path by the mount
scripts). Nginx configs symlinked to `/etc/nginx/` on the server. Nothing in this
repo runs locally — changes take effect only after being pulled to the server.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `arrs/docker-compose.yml` | Media-management stack (`cpam-arrs`): sonarr, radarr, preradarr, lidarr, listenarr, audiobookshelf |
| `infra/docker-compose.yml` | Support stack (`cpam-infra`): sabnzbd, tautulli, wizarr, kometa, seerr, audiobot, doplarr, wrapperr, watchtower |
| `infra/audiobot/` | Custom Discord bot (locally built image): `/audiobooks` mints Wizarr invites for the audiobook library |
| `infra/doplarr/config.toml` | Config for doplarr_rs, the Discord `/request` bot fronting Seerr |
| `infra/kometa/` | Kometa collection/overlay configs + `error_digest.py` (daily Pushover digest of run errors); the live `config.yml` holds secrets and exists only on the server — `config.yml.template` is the committed reference |
| `infra/tautulli/monthly_stats.py` | Cron script: posts Tautulli's 30-day most-popular movies/TV to Discord as a compact ranked list (webhook) |
| `nginx/sites-available/cpam.tv` | All `*.cpam.tv` vhosts (one server block per app) |
| `nginx/conf-available/` | Shared includes: `common.include` (TLS/headers), `cloudflare.ips`, `theme-park.include`, `letsencrypt.include` |
| `mnt_plex.sh` / `umnt_plex.sh` | Bring the storage + arrs + Plex up / down (see boot order below) |
| `syncclouds.sh` | rclone-copy local encrypted media → Google Drive (`gdrive:/cpam`) |
| `autoclean.sh` | Delete oldest local media files when disk usage exceeds a threshold |

## Storage architecture (the part that's easy to break)

Media lives in **encfs-encrypted** directories, merged with **unionfs**:

- `/home/plex/.local-sorted` — encrypted local media (ciphertext)
- `/home/plex/local-sorted` — decrypted local view (encfs mount, **RW**)
- `gdrive:/cpam` → rclone systemd service → `/home/plex/.gdrive-sorted` ciphertext → `/home/plex/gdrive-sorted` decrypted view (**RO**)
- `/home/plex/sorted` — unionfs copy-on-write merge (`local=RW : gdrive=RO`) — **this is what Plex and every container mounts**

`mnt_plex.sh` order matters: rclone service → encfs local → encfs gdrive → unionfs →
`docker compose up` (arrs) → 30s sleep → plexmediaserver. `umnt_plex.sh` is the exact
reverse. Containers started while `/home/plex/sorted` is unmounted will see an empty
dir and can wreak havoc (e.g. arrs mass-deleting "missing" media) — never reorder.

### Encrypted path mappings in `syncclouds.sh`

`TOP_LEVEL_SYNCS` and `TV_SYNCS` map plaintext labels to **encfs ciphertext directory
names** (the gibberish like `m,UWYtVSWaa0IRClxXkOjDDX` = Seinfeld). These are correct;
do not "fix" or normalize them. To add a new show, get its ciphertext name with:

```sh
ENCFS6_CONFIG=/home/plex/encfs6.xml encfsctl encode /home/plex/.local-sorted "TV/Show Name"
```

then add a `"Label|ciphertext"` entry. TV entries are relative to the TV dir
(`XHiIBA-,pmPm6r1We6DzwWh4`); top-level entries are relative to `LOCAL_BASE`.
`autoclean.sh` has its own separate plaintext `SEARCH_DIRS` list — the two lists are
maintained independently and are intentionally not identical (autoclean only lists
what's safe to evict locally, i.e. content already synced to gdrive).

## Docker stacks

- `.env` on the server is **not** committed (and is gitignored). It currently must
  provide: `PUID`, `PGID`, `TZ` (optional), `AUDIOBOT_DISCORD_TOKEN`, `CPAM_GUILD_ID`,
  `AUDIOBOT_CHANNEL_ID`, `WIZARR_API_KEY`, `DOPLARR_DISCORD_TOKEN`, `SEERR_API_KEY`,
  `TAUTULLI_API_KEY`, `STATS_WEBHOOK_URL` (Discord webhook — treat as a secret),
  `PUSHOVER_APP_TOKEN`, `PUSHOVER_USER_KEY` (kometa error digest).
  Don't hardcode UIDs or secrets into the compose files.
- **Host cron** (not compose): `infra/tautulli/monthly_stats.py` runs on the 1st of
  the month, sourcing the same `.env` (`set -a; . .env; set +a`). It fetches
  `get_home_stats` from Tautulli on localhost:8181 and posts one compact webhook
  message (two ranked-list embeds, no posters — a deliberate choice, twice over:
  poster-per-title made posts huge, and image URLs via Tautulli's proxy would leak
  the API key into embeds). Webhook calls need a non-default User-Agent or
  Cloudflare 403s them (error 1010).
- The infra stack also joins an **external** `cpam-shared` network (wizarr, audiobot);
  it must exist on the server before `up`. Wizarr's port is loopback-only
  (`127.0.0.1:5690`) — it's reached via nginx (`invite.cpam.tv`) and
  container-to-container.
- arrs stack pins subnet `172.28.0.0/16`. Host LAN IP is `172.20.20.250` — that's the
  address nginx proxies to and the compose port bindings serve on.
- **audiobookshelf**: config + metadata volumes MUST stay on plain local disk
  (SQLite over encfs/union mounts corrupts). Library dirs are mounted read-only —
  the arr apps own writes to media files. Its port is bound to loopback only
  (`127.0.0.1:13378`); it is reached exclusively via nginx (`listen.cpam.tv`).
- **kometa** runs as a daemon (`restart: unless-stopped`) and relies on its internal
  scheduler (daily at 05:00). Its config dir on the server is
  `/var/lib/plexmediaserver/.config/plex-meta-manager/config/` (legacy PMM name) —
  deploying config changes means copying the `infra/kometa/` files there; the compose
  mount is that dir, not the repo. The live `config.yml` holds secrets and exists
  **only on the server** (gitignored here, never kept in the working copy);
  `config.yml.template` is the committed reference — apply structural changes to
  both. Kometa also rewrites the live config itself (Trakt token refresh), so its
  `trakt.authorization` block legitimately drifts from the template.
- **Host cron** (kometa): `infra/kometa/error_digest.py` runs daily after the 05:00
  kometa run, parses `logs/meta.log`, and sends one Pushover digest of the run's
  deduped errors — deliberately a single message per run (the per-error webhook
  would flood the phone), and it doubles as a heartbeat that kometa actually ran.
  Needs `PUSHOVER_APP_TOKEN`/`PUSHOVER_USER_KEY` from `.env`; `--dry-run` prints
  instead of sending.
- **watchtower** auto-updates all containers daily at 4am and prunes old images.
- **wrapperr** has a known TODO: its config volume mapping (`/opt/wrapperr:/app/config`)
  must exist before cutover (see inline `FIX` comment).
- Container configs live in a mix of `/opt/<app>` and
  `/var/lib/plexmediaserver/.config/<App>` on the server — match the existing pattern
  for the app family when adding services.

## Discord bots

Two bots, deliberately different in origin:

- **audiobot** (`infra/audiobot/`, our own Python/discord.py code, built via
  `build: ./audiobot`): `/audiobooks` mints or re-uses a Wizarr invitation and replies
  ephemerally. Wizarr owns accounts/onboarding; the bot never touches Audiobookshelf or
  passwords. Details that matter:
  - Channel guard: the command only works in `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID`
    (`AUDIOBOT_CHANNEL_ID` in `.env`); unset/`0` **disables** the restriction entirely.
  - State: `/data/invites.json` (host: `/var/lib/plexmediaserver/.config/audiobot`)
    maps Discord user → issued invite. An empty/whitespace file is tolerated (starts
    fresh); corrupt JSON is a deliberate hard-fail, so don't "fix" that by starting
    empty. To reset for testing, `rm` the file or write `{}`.
  - Runs with `Intents.none()` — the "Guilds intent seems to be disabled" warning at
    startup is expected. Wizarr only accepts `EXPIRES_IN_DAYS` of 1, 7, or 30.
  - Deploys need `docker compose up -d --build audiobot` — it's a locally built image,
    so watchtower never updates it and a plain `up -d` keeps running stale code.
- **doplarr** (`ghcr.io/activexray/doplarr_rs`, third-party): `/request movie` and
  `/request series` slash commands that file requests through Seerr. Configured solely
  by `infra/doplarr/config.toml`, mounted read-only at `/config.toml`; secrets enter
  via `${VAR}` env substitution (an unset referenced var is a startup error, i.e.
  crash-loop until `.env` is complete). It talks to Seerr as `http://seerr:5055` on the
  compose default network. Requesters must have their Discord User ID linked in their
  Seerr profile, or `fallback_user_id` must be set.

Channel restriction convention: Discord-side per-command overrides (Server Settings →
Integrations → bot → Channels) control visibility/execution for both bots; audiobot
additionally enforces in code. doplarr has no in-config channel option — Discord-side
is the only layer, and that's fine.

## Nginx / edge

- Everything is fronted by **Cloudflare**: nginx listens only on `172.20.20.250:443`
  with a Cloudflare origin cert (`CF_cpam.tv.pem`), and `cloudflare.ips` restores real
  client IPs (`$http_cf_connecting_ip` is used as `X-Real-IP` in proxy blocks).
- Every server block starts with `include /etc/nginx/conf.d/common.include;`
  (TLS, security headers, error pages). Follow that pattern for new subdomains.
- Repo path is `conf-available/` but includes are referenced at
  `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` on the server — keep the include paths as written.
- `theme-park.include` applies theme-park.dev CSS via `sub_filter` using the `$app`
  variable; currently commented out in most blocks but the `set $app ...` lines are
  kept so it can be re-enabled.

### Subdomain map

| Host | Backend |
|---|---|
| plex.cpam.tv | redirect to app.plex.tv |
| dash.cpam.tv | Organizr (php-fpm) + `/plex/` proxy to :32400 |
| sonarr / radarr / pre / lidarr | :8989 / :7878 / :7879 / :8686 |
| audio.cpam.tv | Listenarr :4545 |
| listen.cpam.tv | Audiobookshelf :13378 (loopback) |
| requests.cpam.tv | Seerr :5055 |
| sabnzbd / tautulli / wrapped | :8080 / :8181 / :8282 |
| invite.cpam.tv | Wizarr :5690 |
| pods.cpam.tv | dir2cast podcast feed (php7.4, basic auth) |

## Conventions

- Shell scripts are plain bash; `syncclouds.sh` is the style reference (strict mode,
  `log()` helper, `--dry-run`/`--list` flags). `autoclean.sh` is third-party
  (Louwrentius) — keep its structure when patching rather than rewriting.
- Secrets never go in this repo: no passphrases, tokens, `.env`, or encfs XML config.
  The encfs ciphertext directory names in `syncclouds.sh` are fine to commit.
- Commit messages are short and lower-case, matching existing history.
- Line endings are LF everywhere, enforced by `.gitattributes` (`* text=auto eol=lf`) —
  the server is Linux and CRLF breaks shell scripts. The Windows-side editor may
  CRLF the working tree; git normalizes on commit, so don't hand-convert.
